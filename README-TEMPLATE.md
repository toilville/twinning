# {{PROJECT_NAME}}

*A prole summer project for the working class coder*

Built by workers, for workers. {{PROJECT_NAME}} is about making technology accessible and useful for everyday people, not just the tech elite.

## What's This About?

- **For the people** - No corporate BS, just honest tools
- **By the people** - Built in spare time by folks who actually use this stuff
- **Keep it simple** - If your grandma can't figure it out, we're doing it wrong
- **Actually useful** - Solving real problems, not Silicon Valley fantasies

## About

{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

This is a grassroots project that emerged from actual need, not venture capital fever dreams. We're building something that matters to regular people trying to get work done.

## Getting Started

### What You Need

Just the basics - we're not here to make you install 47 different tools just to say hello world.

- A computer (obviously)
- {{PREREQUISITES}}
- Basic command line knowledge (if you can `cd` and `ls`, you're good)
- Some free time and curiosity

### Installation

No complicated setup scripts or enterprise deployment nonsense:

```bash
# Grab it
git clone https://github.com/{{USERNAME}}/{{PROJECT_NAME}}.git
cd {{PROJECT_NAME}}

{{INSTALLATION_STEPS}}
```

## Usage

We're still building this, but the goal is dead simple:

```bash
{{USAGE_EXAMPLE}}
```

*More docs coming as we actually write the code*

## Contributing

This is a community project - we're all learning and building together. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the details, but honestly:

1. Fork it
2. Fix/build something
3. Make sure it works
4. Send a pull request
5. We'll figure it out together

No corporate contribution license agreements or legal nonsense. Just good code and good vibes.

## Code of Conduct

We keep it simple: be decent to each other. Full details in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This is a space for working people to build useful things. Leave the ego and elitism at the door.

## License

{{LICENSE_INFO}}

Open source, as it should be. Details TBD, but expect something that keeps it free and open.

## Support & Community

- **Issues** - Found a problem? Tell us about it
- **Discussions** - Got questions or ideas? Let's talk
- **Real talk** - This is built by people with day jobs, so be patient

## Built By

Regular folks who code in their spare time because we think technology should serve people, not profit margins.
