## Twinning Philosophy
Twinning represents the concept of creating a "digital twin" of your personal and professional workflows, enabling AI-human collaboration that amplifies rather than replaces human capability. As part of the toilville #ProleVibeSummer experiment, Twinning demonstrates practical AI integration for real business scenarios.

## Quick Start
1. Review the **EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.pdf** for a high-level overview.
2. Use the **30_DAY_ROADMAP.md** to plan your rollout.
3. Set up Nextcloud and Docker containers for Prometheus, Grafana, and Firefly III.
4. Populate **nutrition_log.csv** and test **extended_merge_metrics.py** for data merging.
5. Explore the Grafana panel designs in **NUTRITION_GRAFANA_DESIGN.md**.
6. Track your progress with the **30_DAY_DAILY_CHECKLIST.md** or import the **NOTION_CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.csv** into Notion/Logseq.

## Integration with Toilville Ecosystem
Twinning connects with other toilville projects:
- **notion-social-automation** – Creative workflow automation
- **rockford-toilville-pipeline** – Data intelligence and processing
- **DUYinoboy** – Audio and creative tools
- **code-of-conduct** – Community standards and practices

## Next Steps
- Migrate from SaaS platforms (Notion, WordPress) to open-source solutions (Logseq, Ghost/Hugo).
- Expand Grafana dashboards for creative output, health, and financial KPIs.
- Set up Whisper and test voice journaling workflows.
- Integrate local LLMs for automated data insights.
- Document AI collaboration effectiveness for #ProleVibeSummer
