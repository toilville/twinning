# Creative Workflow Automation Guide

## Overview
This guide covers integrating creative tools (Ableton Live, DaVinci Resolve, LSDj, M8) into the Phase 0.5 Toolkit for logging and analysis.

## Steps
1. **Centralize Project Files**
   - Use Nextcloud or NAS directories to store project files.
   - Configure Ableton and DaVinci to save directly into synced directories.

2. **Automated Exports**
   - Create scripts that watch for new renders/exports and log metadata (date, project name, duration).
   - Example: A Python script using `watchdog` to log new `.wav` or `.mp4` files.

3. **Activity Tracking**
   - Use [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/) to log time spent in creative applications.
   - Integrate these logs into Prometheus or InfluxDB for visualization in Grafana.

4. **Creative Output Metrics**
   - Log the number of songs completed, hours edited, or writing word counts in a `creative_log.csv`.
   - Use `extended_merge_metrics.py` to merge these logs with health and financial data.

## Future Enhancements
- Auto-tagging creative projects based on topics or themes using LLMs.
- Dashboard panels for creative milestones and productivity trends.
