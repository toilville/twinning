# Voice Journal to Insights Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to implement voice journaling and transform audio logs into structured insights.

## Steps
1. **Voice Recording**
   - Use a dedicated voice recorder or iOS Shortcuts to capture daily audio entries.
   - Sync recordings to a Nextcloud "Voice Notes" folder.

2. **Transcription with Whisper**
   - Install Whisper (`pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git`).
   - Create a script to monitor the "Voice Notes" folder and transcribe new files to text.

3. **Storage**
   - Save transcriptions as Markdown files with timestamps and tags.
   - Sync to Joplin, Obsidian, or a Git-backed notes system.

4. **AI Summaries**
   - Use local LLMs to generate daily/weekly summaries from voice transcripts.
   - Create Grafana annotations for notable journal entries.

## Future Enhancements
- Add voice commands for logging structured data (e.g., health metrics).
- Integrate with calendar and tasks for contextual journaling.
