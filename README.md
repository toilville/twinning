# Prole Vibe Summer Template

**#ProleVibeSummer Project Template**

*A Toilville template for AI-amplified development*

---

## Using This Template

This repository is designed as a template for new #ProleVibeSummer projects. To get started:

1. Click the green **"Use this template"** button on GitHub.
2. Create your new repository from this template.
3. Run `./setup-prole-project.sh` to customize your project files.
4. Start building something that amplifies human expertise with AI collaboration.

---

Let the algorithms toil while the humans vibe. This template helps you create projects that use AI to amplify human excellence, not replace it.

## What's This About?

- **AI amplification** - Using algorithms to enhance human expertise, not replace it
- **Real-world testing** - Building tools that work in actual business operations, not just demos
- **Constant iteration** - Expecting multiple attempts and human course correction
- **Transparent process** - Documenting what actually works vs. what sounds good in theory

## About

This is a Toilville project template for creating #ProleVibeSummer experiments - AI-powered projects that amplify human excellence through thoughtful collaboration. Based on 20+ years of workplace automation experience, this template helps you build tools that keep humans in the loop while letting algorithms handle the toil.

The template includes:
- **README template** with placeholder system for easy customization
- **Contributing guidelines** that encourage iterative AI-human collaboration
- **Code of conduct** that keeps things respectful and productive
- **Setup script** for automated project initialization
- **Issue templates** for documenting AI workflow iterations and results

## Getting Started

### Using This Template

Ready to start a #ProleVibeSummer experiment? Here's how:

1. **Click "Use this template"** on GitHub to create your new repository
2. **Clone your new repo** locally
3. **Run the setup script** to customize your project:
   ```bash
   ./setup-prole-project.sh
   ```
4. **Follow the prompts** to fill in your project details
5. **Start building** AI-amplified tools that keep humans in the loop

### What You Need

Just the basics - we're not here to overcomplicate things:

- A computer (obviously)
- Git and a GitHub account
- Basic command line knowledge (if you can `cd` and `ls`, you're good)
- Some curiosity about AI-human collaboration

---

### Template Features

This template gives you everything you need to start a proper #ProleVibeSummer project:

- **README template** with placeholders for documenting AI workflows
- **Contributing guidelines** that encourage iterative development  
- **Code of conduct** based on the Toilville standard
- **Issue templates** for tracking AI iterations and human interventions
- **Setup script** that handles all the tedious customization work

## Template Usage

Once you've used this template and run the setup script, you'll have a fully customized project ready for AI-human collaboration:

```bash
# After running setup-prole-project.sh, your README will be customized
# Your CONTRIBUTING.md will be ready for documenting AI workflows
# Your issue templates will help track iterations and human interventions
# Time to start building AI tools that amplify human expertise!
```

The setup script handles all the placeholder replacement automatically, so you can focus on what matters: building AI systems that enhance human capabilities rather than replacing them.

## The Toilville Philosophy

At Toilville, we believe humans stay in the loop. Even during AI experiments.

The best AI doesn't replace human expertise - it amplifies it. But amplification only works if you know what you're amplifying and why. This template helps you build projects that:

- Expect multiple iterations and constant human course correction
- Document what actually works vs. what sounds good in demos  
- Keep humans involved in critical decision-making
- Measure real outcomes, not just fancy busywork

## Contributing to This Template

Got ideas for improving this template? Found a way to make AI-human workflows smoother? Want to help make #ProleVibeSummer experiments more effective? Jump in!

This template is a Toilville project - we're testing what actually works in AI collaboration, not just what sounds good in theory. Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the details, but honestly:

1. Fork this template repository
2. Improve something (better placeholders, smoother setup, clearer iteration tracking)
3. Test it with real AI workflows
4. Send a pull request
5. We'll figure it out together

No corporate contribution license agreements or legal nonsense. Just good templates and useful experiments.

## Code of Conduct

We keep it simple: be decent to each other. Full details in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This is a space for testing AI-human collaboration. Leave the ego and unrealistic AI hype at the door.

## License

Open source, as it should be. Details TBD, but expect something that keeps it free and open.
