# Twinning

**AI-Augmented Self-Hosted Infrastructure Platform**

*A #ProleVibeSummer Project - Built by workers, for workers - amplifying human expertise through data sovereignty*

---

## What is Twinning?

A #ProleVibeSummer experiment in self-hosted AI infrastructure designed for complete data ownership, privacy-focused analytics, and human-amplified insights. Part of Toilville's week-long test of AI-only business operations - demonstrating that algorithms can toil while humans vibe.

**Key Features:**
- **Complete data sovereignty** - Self-hosted Nextcloud, databases, analytics
- **Privacy-focused AI** - Local LLMs, on-device processing, encrypted storage  
- **Comprehensive analytics** - Health, finance, creative, business metrics
- **AI-assisted insights** - Automated summaries, trend analysis, predictions

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**: Docker, Docker Compose
2. **Deploy**: `docker-compose up -d`
3. **Access**:
   - Nextcloud: http://localhost:8080
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - Firefly III: http://localhost:8081

## Architecture

**Phase 0.5:** Nextcloud + Docker + Prometheus/Grafana + Firefly III + InfluxDB  
**Phase 1.0:** + Local LLMs + Whisper + SaaS migration tools  
**Phase 2.0:** + Federated sync + ML predictions + Voice agent

## Implementation Phases

- **Phase 0.5** (0-30 days): Foundation infrastructure
- **Phase 1.0** (1-3 months): AI integration & SaaS migration  
- **Phase 2.0** (3-12 months): Advanced AI & federated systems

See `docs/PHASE_*_TODO.md` for detailed implementation plans.

## #ProleVibeSummer Philosophy

"Let the algorithms toil while the humans vibe" - Twinning embodies this philosophy by handling the operational infrastructure while humans focus on strategic thinking and creative work.

## Built By

Toilville Consulting - Testing AI collaboration that amplifies human expertise rather than replacing it.
