# Contributing to Twining

*A prole summer project - built by working folks, for working folks*

Thanks for wanting to help build something useful! This isn't some corporate open source project with layers of bureaucracy. We're just regular people trying to make tools that actually matter.

## Ground Rules

Simple: don't be a jerk. Full details in our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), but the gist is treat people like human beings, not code-producing machines.

## How to Jump In

### Found a Bug?

Don't overthink it:
- Check if someone else already reported it
- If not, tell us what broke and how
- Include what you were trying to do
- Screenshots help if it's visual

No fancy templates required - just be clear about what's wrong.

### Got an Idea?

Great! Tell us:
- What problem would this solve?
- Who would use it?
- Why is this worth building?

We're building for real users with real problems, not feature creep.

### Want to Code?

Here's the deal:

1. **Fork it**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/twining.git
   cd twining
   ```

2. **Make a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix-the-thing
   ```

3. **Do the work**
   - Keep it simple and readable
   - Don't break existing stuff
   - Test your changes (even if it's just "does it work?")
   - Write a decent commit message

4. **Send it back**
   - Open a pull request
   - Explain what you changed and why
   - Be ready to chat about it

No corporate code review process - we'll work it out together.

## Development Setup

We're keeping this simple. No 47-step setup process.

### What You Need

- A computer that can run code
- Git (probably already have it)
- Basic command line skills
- Whatever language/runtime we end up using

### Getting Started

```bash
# Grab the code
git clone your-fork
cd twining

# We'll add actual setup steps as we build this
```

### Testing

```bash
# Make sure your changes work
# We'll add proper tests as the project grows
```

## Keep It Simple

### Writing Code

- **Readable over clever** - Your future self will thank you
- **Simple over complex** - If you need a PhD to understand it, rewrite it
- **Working over perfect** - Ship something useful, then make it better
- **Comments for the why** - The code shows what, comments explain why

### Commit Messages

Just be clear:
- "Fix the login bug" ✓
- "refactor user authentication subsystem architecture" ✗
- "Add search to the dashboard" ✓
- "implement polymorphic query optimization" ✗

### Documentation

- If you change how something works, update the docs
- If you add something new, explain how to use it
- If it's confusing, add a comment

## How We Review

No bureaucracy, just common sense:

1. **Someone else looks at your code** - Fresh eyes catch bugs
2. **We talk about it** - Questions, suggestions, improvements
3. **You fix anything needed** - Work together to make it good
4. **Ship it** - Get useful code to users

Remember: we're all doing this in our spare time, so be patient and be kind.

## Community Vibes

- **Help newcomers** - We were all beginners once
- **Share knowledge** - Teach what you know, learn what you don't
- **Stay practical** - Focus on building useful stuff
- **Keep it real** - No pretentious tech bro nonsense

## Need Help?

- **Stuck on something?** Open an issue and ask
- **Not sure how to contribute?** Just start somewhere small
- **Want to chat?** Use discussions or issues
- **Found a typo?** Fix it and send a PR

We're all figuring this out together.

## Props

Everyone who helps gets credit. We'll keep track in:
- README contributors section
- Release notes when we ship stuff
- General appreciation for making useful things

## Legal Stuff

By contributing, you're agreeing your code can be used under whatever open license we pick. Nothing sneaky, just keeping things free and open.
